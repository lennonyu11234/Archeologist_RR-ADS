# Rapid Response Antimicrobial Peptide Design Strategy Driven by Meta-Learning for Emerging Drug-Resistant Pathogens

## Abstract
Purpose:Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) constitues a pressing public health crisis, posing a substantial threat to global health security. In order to swiftly respond to and control the spread of emerging drug-resistant bacteria at the onset of their proliferation, our aim is to develop a  Rapid Response Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) design strategy (RR-ADS).
Methods: Our approach harnesses the combined power of meta-learning and reinforcement learning to enable the model to achieve robust generalization with a minimal dataset, thereby expediting the response process. This strategy ensures the rapid and efficient generation of AMPs that exhibit superior biocompatibility and are specifically tailored to combat drug-resistant pathogens.
Results: Our model has achieved satisfactory results across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating the capability to accurately identify and generate AMPs targeted against drug-resistant bacteria with minimal sample sizes. Building on this, we completed the generation and validation of AMPs against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii within two weeks, with a positive rate of 93.3%.
Conclusion: RR-ADS has effectively demonstrated the potential of meta-learning in tasks involving bioactive peptides and holds promise as an effective alternative measure to address infectious disease public health emergencies.
